1. use const, enum, and inline rather than #define
	- use const when needs to debug(tracking address)
	- use enum when dont want let them be tracked (no address/memory assignment to enum value)
	- use inline function rather than #define macro

2.  To avoid the code duplication, set non-const member function call const member function
