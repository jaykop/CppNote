*There are at least two (related) potential problems
with SSHashFirst4 function. What are they?
???

*Linear probing - O(1)??
=>
	If the table is sparsely populated, searching is fast
since we’d expect to perform one or two probes.
 If the table is nearly full, we will be spending most
of our time resolving collisions. O(N) is the worst
case.
